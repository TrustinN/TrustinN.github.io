              <p>
                The project focused on methods of aligning images and
                understanding techniques that are fundamental to image
                processing such as application of gaussian and lapalcian stacks
                and image pyramids.
              </p>
              <p>
                Image alignment is an important topic in computer vision, and
                arises in many problems such as image transformation, stitching,
                and registration.

              <h2>Project 2: Fun With Filters and Frequencies</h2>
              <p>
                Filters are effective tools for edge detection and separating
                frequencies. They are powerful because they line up closely with
                how people process visual data. In convoluting a filter with an
                image, we are essentially finding points in the image where the
                filter matches the image, a form of template matching. Our
                brains essentially does the same process, and contains neurons
                dedicated to detecting certain features in an image, such as an
                oriented edge/pattern.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this project, I explore using filters to separate frequencies
                between images to do cool things such as blending.

              <h2>Project 3: Face Morphing and Modeling a Photo Collection</h2>
              <p>
                Filters act on the pixels of an image, but we can also consider
                transformations on the positions of these pixels. If we think of
                images as a function from \(I: \mathbb{R}^{2} \rightarrow
                \mathbb{R}\), where the position of a pixel is mapped to a
                value, there there is a class of transformations \(T\) that
                augment the pixel locations. \begin{equation*} I(T(x)) = y
                \end{equation*} This project explores these transformations,
                specifically affine transformations, and their use in mapping
                triangles to triangles for face morphing.

              <h2>Project 4: Image Warping and Mosaicing</h2>
              <p>
                The previous project looks at a euclidean mapping (rotation
                followed by displacement), but if we want to account for shifts
                in perspective, this is not enough. This is where homographies
                come in, which allows us to map quadrilaterals to
                quadrilaterals.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this, we can create panoramas by taking multiple pictures,
                processing with a perspective warp, and stitching them together.
                This project also explores automatic image alignment to make the
                stitching process easier.

              <p>
                Many image processing techniques for removing noise are not
                effective. We can use linear/nonlinear filters to get different
                results depending on the input image, but these are not flexible
                when dealing with a lot of noise.
              </p>
              <p>
                Training a denoiser helps us with this complex task of denoising
                and also offers an interesting way to generate new images. We
                can start with pure noise and itereatively denoise this to
                obtain a clean image that looks realistic. Combined with several
                other techniques, we can obtain a wide range of images.
