            <p>
              To morph one image to another, I would need to define keypoints in
              both images such that one image's keypoints map to the other. I
              used python's ginput function from matplotlib to define the
              keypoints:

            <img src="./media/KeyPointsPart1.png" alt="keypoints" width="600" />
            <p>
              In selecting the keypoints, I had to make sure that close
              keypoints were not colinear to ensure that there was a
              triangulation. Also important was ensuring that the resulting
              triangles well partitioned the image such that no two different
              elements were in the same triangle. For example, if a triangle
              corresponding to the first image captured some of the hair and the
              background while the other did not, a fragment of the hair would
              morph inconsitantly with the rest of the hair. Finally, keypoints
              were set in the corners to ensure that the entire image was
              morphed and not just the head.

            <h2>Computing the Midway Face</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                To get the midway face, the average of the keypoints were first
                calculated to determine the keypoints on the midway face.
                Delauney triangulation gave triangles that indexed into both the
                keypoints for the midway face along with the keypoints for the
                two images to be morphed. Using this, the affine transformation
                for mapping the midway triangle's vertices on each of the two
                image's triangle's vertices could be computed. This allowed me
                to pull the rgb pixel values from both the source images,
                interpolated, to set in the midway image's triangle. As for the
                details of the implementation, I created an
                <code
                  >inverseWarp(source, sourceTri, dest, destTri,
                  color=True)</code
                >
                function which uses the pixel values in the source image located
                at the sourceTriangle. Using scipy's griddata method, I used
                this data to interpolate the values for the destination
                triangle. With skimage's polygon method, I could get the indices
                for the destination triangle
                <code>destRR, destCC = polygon(destTri)</code> such that
                <code>dest[destRR, destCC] = res</code>, where
                <code>res</code> is the interpolated data. I used the
                <code>inverseWarp</code> function over all the simplices in the
                triangulation to get two morphs from the original images to the
                midway face.

            <p>
              All that is left is to calculate frames between image1 and the
              midway face and between the midway face and image2 to get a morph
              sequence from image1 to image2. This was done by first setting the
              start and target images for the current frame such that the
              current frame's image was somewhere between the start and target
              images. Then I used linear interpolation to determine where the
              keypoints lie in the current frame. This is determined by
              <code>warpFrac</code> which lies between 0 and 1, 0 being the
              start of the morph and 1 being the end. Then the current keypoints
              are given by
              <code>startKp + warpFrac * (targetKp - startKp)</code> if
              <code>warpFrac < 0.5</code>. If <code>warpFrac > 0.5</code>, I
              used <code>2 * warpFrac - 1</code>. After warping the start and
              target images to the new keypoints, a dissolve fraction was used
              to determine the blend of the two results for the current frame in
              a similar manner to the warp fraction.

            <p>
              To get the mean face, I used the faces from the FEI database.
              Getting the mean face is adding all the images and dividing by the
              number of images.

              To morph a given face, f, and its keypoints, f_k, to the average
              face, I used the same method for computing the midway face. Using
              the average keypoints computed for the average face, I got data
              for it by interpolating from the data given on the triangles
              <code>f[f_k[simplex]]</code>. Here are some results, where the
              images are shown in pairs. The left image is the original and the
              right is the image morphed to the average:

              Using the annotatations for the image, I labeled my face with
              keypoints in the same order. I noticed that there were some
              keypoints missing for the top of the forehead, so I added them to
              get more accurate results. Here are pictures of my face morphed to
              the average and the average morphed to my face:

              To get a caricature I extrapolated data from the mean. I took a
              difference <code>myface - mean = diff</code> and for
              <code>alpha > 1</code> or <code>alpha <0 </code>, I computed
              <code> alpha * mean + (1 - alpha) * myface</code>.
